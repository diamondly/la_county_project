# Employee Access Parking Control System

## Project Description

This project is a web-based Parking Control System that uses React for the front-end, Node/Express for the back-end, and SQLite for database integration. It implements the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to separate the application logic and improve code maintainability. The MVC pattern separates the application logic into three main components: the Model, the View, and the Controller. The Model represents the data and the business logic, the View represents the user interface, and the Controller handles the communication between the Model and the View. This separation allows for more modular and maintainable code, as well as easier testing and debugging.
